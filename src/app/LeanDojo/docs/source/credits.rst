LeanDojo draws on numerous existing tools for interacting with and extracting data from proof assistants. 
The author benefited a lot from the lessons he learned when designing and implementing 
`CoqGym <https://github.com/princeton-vl/CoqGym>`_. 
LeanDojo's interaction implementation partially incorporates `lean-gym <https://github.com/openai/lean-gym>`_'s code but 
fixes some critical issues and expanded its functionality. When prototyping the data extraction part of LeanDojo, the author 
found `Jason Rute <https://jasonrute.github.io/>`_'s `lean_proof_recording <https://github.com/jasonrute/lean_proof_recording>`_ helpful.
Its design was a hacky but extremely clever piece of art. Fortunately, we didn't have to follow that design thanks to Lean's AST exporting mechanism 
(:code:`lean --ast --tsast --tspp`) implemented by `Mario Carneiro <https://www.cmu.edu/hoskinson/people/mario-carneiro.html>`_, 
`Gabriel Ebner <https://gebner.org/>`_, and `Daniel Selsam <https://dselsam.github.io/>`_. 
LeanDojo's mechanism for exporting Lean 4 ASTs is inspired by the conversations with Mario Carneiro during Kaiyu Yang's visit to `Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics <https://www.cmu.edu/hoskinson/>`_ (directed by `Jeremy Avigad <https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/>`_) at CMU.
